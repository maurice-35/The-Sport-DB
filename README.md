#  Overview
This was the first project I built using React and APIs, after studying both during the previous week. It was quite a challenging project as I did not feel confident in the understanding of either of the two, but I finally became confident in the end.

#  Brief
As a solo project, I had 8 days to develop an app using React and fetch data from a  free public API. I had to do the following:


The second project is to **build a React application** that consumes a **public API**.
‚Äã
### Technical Requirements
‚Äã
Your app must:
‚Äã
* **Consume a public API** ‚Äì this could be anything but it must make sense for your project.
* **Have several components**
* **The app can have a router** - with several "pages", this is up to you and if it makes sense for your project.
* **Include wireframes** - that you designed before building the app.
* **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public (hosted on your public github, not GA github!)
‚Äã

‚Äã
### Necessary Deliverables
‚Äã
* A **working application**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the _very beginning_ of the project
* **A `readme.md` file** with:
 * Explanations of the **technologies** used
   * A couple of paragraphs about the **general approach you took**
   * **Installation instructions** for any dependencies
   * Link to your **wireframes** ‚Äì sketches of major views / interfaces in your application
  * Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** your team had to overcome

#  Approach

## Day 1:
I started by thinking of the kind of app to build. I had little or no idea of what I would build. After about a day of online searches of different APIs, I finally decided to build a cat-app based on the ‚Äòthecatapi.com‚Äô API.

## Day 2:

### Wireframe

On the second, I started with the wireframe.
I made a short plan using Figma.com as shown below.

#  Process

For the rest of the other days, I continued the process. I started by setting up the `App.js page`. I then requested the data from the API and made sure I was receiving this on the console in the developer tool.

I created the `navBar page` and the cats folder. I moved the content of `App.js` to the `CatModel` file and replaced it by creating route paths for each route. 
I created the `home page`.

    useEffect(() => {
        const getData = async () => {
          try {
            const { data } = await axios.get('https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/breeds')
            setBreeds(data)
            // console.log(data)
            // console.log('response', breeds)
          } catch (err) {
            console.log(err)
          }
        }
        getData()
      }, [])

In the `navBar page`, I created links to the `sign up and login pages`, as well as the `see all cats` page. 


     return (
        <nav className="navbar is-dark">
          <div className="container">
            <div className="navbar-brand">
              <span role="img">
                <Link to="/">üêà</Link>
              </span>
            </div>
            <div className="navebar-start">
              <div className="navbar-item">
                <Link target="-blank" to="/breeds">See all Cats</Link>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div className="navbar-end">
              <div className="navbar-item">
                <Link target="-blank" to="/breeds">Breeds</Link>
              </div>
              <div className="navbar-item">
                <Link target="-blank" to="/categories">Categories</Link>
              </div>
              <div className="navbar-item">
                <Link target="-blank" to="/votes">Votes</Link>
              </div>
              <div className="navbar-item">
                <Link target="-blank" to="/favourites">Favourites</Link>
              </div>
              <div className="navbar-item">
                <Link target="-blank" to="/images">Images</Link>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
        </nav>
      )
      

#  Wins

- As this is the very first project in which I used Axios to make a request from an API, it was a great experience to see those images displayed on the site.    
- Working solo on this project was an experience on its own as I struggled and finally came out with something to display.

#  Challenges
The main challenge was to display the images on the browser. As a result of the nature of the API, it was not easy to display images but I finally succeeded to do so after some extra research. 


#  Future Features

This final output does not cover all  intentions and plans for the project. As a result, I intend to make some improvements on this project particularly on:
- Improving the card, categories, votes, and favourite pages.
- Adding the sign up and login pages.

#  Key learnings

- The ability to access API endpoints and leverage them using Insomnia.
- Building a project with more than one page and linking them to the ‚ÄònavBar‚Äô was a great achievement.
