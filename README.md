#  Overview
This was the first project I built using React and APIs, after studying both during the previous week. It was quite a challenging project as I did not feel confident in the understanding of either of the two, but I finally became confident in the end.

#  Brief
As a solo project, I had 8 days to develop an app using React and fetch data from a  free public API. I had to do the following:


The second project is to **build a React application** that consumes a **public API**.
​
#### Technical Requirements
​
Your app must:
​
* **Consume a public API** – this could be anything but it must make sense for your project.
* **Have several components**
* **The app can have a router** - with several "pages", this is up to you and if it makes sense for your project.
* **Include wireframes** - that you designed before building the app.
* **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public (hosted on your public github, not GA github!)
​

​
#### Necessary Deliverables
​
* A **working application**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the _very beginning_ of the project
* **A `readme.md` file** with:
 * Explanations of the **technologies** used
   * A couple of paragraphs about the **general approach you took**
   * **Installation instructions** for any dependencies
   * Link to your **wireframes** – sketches of major views / interfaces in your application
  * Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** your team had to overcome
